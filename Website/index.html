1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the div. The elements within this div have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

	<p>Infected is a Death-Match Multiplayer Mod where you can play with your friends as Zombies against Humans. Inside of a beautiful mansion, protect your home for a given duration in time chosen by the Host Server as it is attacked by Player Zombies. </p>
	<h3>Zombies	</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Zombies have spawning points inside of the forest. The goal of a Zombie is to infect all of the Humans and turn them into Zombies as you kill them with your sword. Though Zombies do not have Ammo, they have a huge Melee advantage when coming into close combat. They also have a huge advantage in their speed.</p>

<h3>Humans</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Humans spawn inside of the mansion. Their advantage is when they spot a Zombie from a long distance. Any melee combat is nearly impossible since humans don't inflict much damage except with the limited ammo that they have equiped. Health and ammo can be replentished in the dark forest where Zombies spawn when killed.</p>
